# Jay Westgate Brand Guidelines

## Brand Identity: Jay Westgate (Author Persona)
- **Vibe:** Exciting, fandom-focused, and bold. While the stories are "timeless," the visual brand is modern and high-energy.
- **Visual Style:** Not "moody author." Break from conservative styling. 
- **Primary Color:** Bright Pink (#FF007F or similar neon/vibrant pink).
- **Typography:** Bold, clean, and modern. 

## Technical & Personal Constraints
- **Localization:** I am in Lara, Australia. Use `en-AU` for dates, currency, and spelling (e.g., "colour," "centre").
- **Strict Sobriety Policy:** I am sober. Never generate code, placeholder text, or images that reference alcohol, bars, or drinking culture. 

## AI Instructions for Development
- **UI Components:** Use the Bright Pink as an accent for buttons, borders, and active states. 
- **Tone of Voice:** When writing placeholder copy or documentation, be engaging and "fan-centric" rather than academic or overly formal.
- **Next.js/Tailwind:** Always default to mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind utility classes.
